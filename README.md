# COMP206
A repository to document the homework assignments I have done for the class
The class was split up into three sections, the first month being bash scripting and working around linux/the terminal, which is represented in homeworks 1-4

## Homework 1
A very basic homework assignment - creating a directory structure, copy files to and from a remote server using ssh

## Homework 2
Automating backing up a filesystem recursivley, automate pulling from github, working will failures.

## Homework 3
Parsing a CSV with bash scripts - very interesting assignment, and it also taught me the most about bash scripting.

## Homework 4
Log file analysis with bash scripting, such as getting different fields, displaying them, etc.
We also re-implimented the linux tree and find commands ourselves with bash scripting.

## Homework 5
Our first C programming assignment. We wrote a bash script to build the C program, and included a suite of automatic tests that tested the script against expected inputs and outputs.
The C program included many methods depending on which command line arguments the user gave the script. Input validation, working with integers, managing strings/character arrays, are all skills tested by this assignment.

## Homework 6
Here we improved the amount and quility of tests in the build script using a function that made the process easier. We also implimented dynamic memory in C using the heap instead of the stack. We also made a MakeFile to compile the C programs and automatically test them with one simple command.

## Homework 7
In this assignment we look at how clients and servers interact on the web by implimenting them. We created a client and a server script that when ran on seperate linux instances on the same network could send text messages between each other. This was expanded to impliment polling so that multiple clients could connect to the server, practically creating a chat room where the clients could see the messages other clients send.

## Homework 8
This was an infosec assignment where we practiced exploiting buffer overflows and injection attacks to gain access to a system. There isn't a lot of code here, but an explination of the process needed for the exploits.
