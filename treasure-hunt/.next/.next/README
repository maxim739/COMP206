# New commands unlocked

It's dangerous to go alone. Take these:

- `cp SRC DST`
    - copies the entry located at SRC to DST
    - only copies a single _file_ by default, not directories
    - use `-r` option to Recursively copy directories and their contents
- `rm FILE`
    - ReMoves an file. The deletion is permanent and the file cannot be recovered.
    - only removes a single _file_ by default, not directories
    - use `-r` option to Recursively delete directories and their contents
- `mv SRC DST`
    - MoVes an entry from SRC to DST
    - the entry can be either a file or a directory; no `-r` is needed.
    - this is also used to rename entries
- `rmdir DIR`
    - ReMoves a DIRectory.
    - The directory must be empty for this to succeed.

(No really, take notes on those commands.)

You notice a door at the back of the room, but it's locked...
