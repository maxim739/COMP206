I tried to commit using
git add .
git commit -m " "
from my hw2 directory but it didn't work, so I re-cloned the hw2 gitlabs and moved my relevent
files to there and did the process there, so I hope that works.

I got the
fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /) 
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
error and I didn't know what to do :|

sorry
