Q1.1 - How do you use tar to create an archive?
	To create an archive, you must run the tar program with the -c command for 'create' and then
	the archive file and where you want to place it, and then the directory or files you want to
	archive

	tar -c [path and filename of archive] [the directory or file to archive]

Q1.2 - How do you use tar to list the contents of an archive?
	To use tar to list the contents of an archive you can use the --list option for tar

	tar --list --file=[archive file] [directory in archived file]

Q1.3 - How do you use tar to extract the entire contents of an archive?
	To extract the entire archive you only need the archive file name, without and induvidual
	file names or other arguments

	tar -xvf collection.tar

	the -v flag is not needed, but represents verbose, which allows you to see whats going on
	behind the hood

Q1.4 - By default, where do all of the files get extracted to?
	By default, if the files have their absolute paths, then they will extract themselves back to
	the path they had before they were archived, this means that you could overwrite updated
	files when you extract a tar.gz

Q1.5 - What is the significance of the two extensions .tar.gz?
	.tar stands for tape archive which is a format used to store many files, and .gz stands for 
	gzip, which is a way to compress .tar files into a smaller file

Q1.6 - What is a tarbomb? Why could extracting one be dangerous?
	A tarbomb is when someone extracts a lot of files in a tar file into a directory, and all of
	the files extract everywhere, sometimes overwriting existing files and ending up all over the
	place. You can save yourself from this mishap by looking at the tar file using -t to look at
	the files within the tar file before extracting it, or by moving the tar file to a new
	directory so that it will only explode in one place.
